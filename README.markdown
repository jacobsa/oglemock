This project is an attempt to create a unit mocking framework for the Go
programming language with the following features:

 *  An extensive and extensible set of matchers for expressing call
    expectations.

 *  Clean, readable output that tells you exaclty what you need to know.

 *  Style and semantics similar to [Google Mock][googlemock] and
    [Google JS Test][google-js-test].

It is not yet ready for general use.
